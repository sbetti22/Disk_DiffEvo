MCFOST Python Utilities
==============================

This package implements a suite of utilities for working with
radiative transfer models of circumstellar dust computed with the
MCFOST Monte Carlo and ray-tracing radiative transfer code (Pinte
et al. 2006, 2009).

Please note this is not the MCFOST radiative transfer code itself
(in Fortran) but rather a set of accompanying Python utilities.
The names are identical since they are two accompanying parts of the
same computing environment, but they're not the same codes.



INSTALLATION
--------------

To install:
	python setup.py install

To install in developer mode: (i.e. using symlinks to point directly
at this directory, so that code changes here are immediately available
without needing to repeat the above step):

	python setup.py develop



USAGE DOCUMENTATION
---------------------
See http://www.stsci.edu/~mperrin/software/mcfostpy/ for (partial) documentation and example code.
